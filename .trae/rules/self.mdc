## General Patterns to Avoid

### Type Safety
- **Avoid**: Using `any` type
- **Prefer**: `unknown` with type guards or proper typing

### Error Handling
- **Avoid**: Silencing errors with empty catch blocks
- **Prefer**: Proper error logging and user-friendly error messages

### Database Queries
- **Avoid**: N+1 query problems
- **Prefer**: Using Prisma `include` or `select` to fetch related data in one query

### Security
- **Avoid**: Trusting client-side validation alone
- **Prefer**: Always validate and authorize on the backend
